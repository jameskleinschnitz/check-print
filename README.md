# check-print: Print Checks From Your Web Browser

This is an HTML file that formats check properties for printing on PeachTree Checks - directly from a web browser. 


## Directions

1. Pull down the project (or just copy and paste the contents of check-template-standard-business.html into a text editor).
1. In this HTML file, search for every occurrence of "REPLACE-ME". These are the values for check \#1 that you can (and should) replace/customize:

 - **date** - The date when the check is first eligible to be cashed/deposited.
 - **payTo** - To whom the check should be made out.
 - **amountNbr** - The amount of the check, as a number.
 - **amountTxt** - The amount of the check, written out long-form.
 - **payToAddress** - Lines 1 through 5 of the recipient's address.
 - **memo** - A short note to include on the check.

1. The same values can be set/customized for checks \#2 and \#3. If you only need to print one check, leave the values for these two blank. If you only need to print two checks, leave the values for the third check blank.
1. Save the file and open it in your web browser.
1. Use your web browser's print function to print your checks. (Be sure to feed your pre-printed checks into your printer first, of course.)

## Caveats

I've tested this on the following browsers:

* Chrome on Mac OS X
* (that's it :)

In addition, I've only tested this on my one printer, with one set of checks. So, your mileage may vary.

## Possible Future Enhancements

* Support for other check formats. (e.g., wallet checks, etc.)
* Ability to supply check properties from a form instead of editing HTML.
* Suggestions?

I'm not an experienced git or GitHub user. So, if you see anything about the project that is wrong, embarrassing, or ill-advised, please let me know. Thanks!
